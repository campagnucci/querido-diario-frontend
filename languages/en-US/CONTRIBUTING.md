## Guidelines to maintainers

This section is a space for project maintainers, since as code review and repository organization are part of the contribution process, all code review guidelines are of public interest to anyone in the community.

### Responsibilities of a Querido Diario maintainer:

- Respect the [code of conduct](https://github.com/okfn-brasil/querido-diario/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and ensure that anyone who may have suffered harassment has a help channel.
- Always justify a suggestion according to the practices already adopted in the project, legibility and simplicity. It is essential for a civil project to have a structure as easy as possible for beginners.
- The maintainers should **run all the spiders before merging it**.
- If a Pull Request have many commits and their messages are not clear, use the *Squash and merge* option. It is not necessary to do squash when the commits discipline is good, as an example: [Pull Request](https://github.com/okfn-brasil/querido-diario/pull/252/commits).
