# Querido Diario Search Platform Frontend

This repository contains all the resources needed to build the *frontend*
of the [Querido Diario Search Platform](https://queridodiario.ok.org.br/).
If you want to contribute, you are more than welcome!

## Setup of the development environment

To run the project, you will need to have the [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) in the version specified in the `"engines"` section of [file `package.json`](package.json). It is recommended to use some node version manager, such as [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

In addition to node, you also need [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed.

With these programs installed, let's install the dependencies using yarn:

```sh
$ yarn
```

Once installed, we must install the [Angular](https://angular.io/) cli using the command:

```sh
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
```

After that, you will be able to serve the project in a local environment with the command:

```sh
$ ng serves
```
